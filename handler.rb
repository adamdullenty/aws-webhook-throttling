#Â Hard coded queue URL - could be configured via Serverless in a real world example:
QUEUE_URL = "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/109917559150/webhook-test-2-dev-webhookQueue"
# Replace this URL with an endpoint that you own that that can receive and log POST requests:
REQUEST_BIN_URL = "https://enmw2ww7ngty8tf.m.pipedream.net/"

# Proof of concept SQS throttling solution for inbound webhooks
# This consists of:
# * API Gateway endpoint that triggers a Lambda function
#   * This Lambda pushes the webhook payload into SQS unaltered (so we capture the
#     data before introducing any chance of parsing errors occurring) - we could push
#     the entire API Gateway event, or include the headers for HMAC verification, etc
#   * It should be possible to handle the HMAC auth within the API Gateway config too
#   * In theory this intermediary Lambda function is not really required; AWS supports
#     API Gateway pushing events directly into SQS, but it was tricky to get this
#     working via Serverless
# * An SQS queue for webhook payloads
# * A Lambda function that receives SQS events (batch size 1), parses the event body,
#   and posts it to an API endpoint
#   * This Lambda has a max concurrency of 1, which enables this method of throttling
#     inbound API requests
#   * If our internal API endpoint could handle batched updates, we could also
#     increase the batch size here and post multiple updates to our API at once
